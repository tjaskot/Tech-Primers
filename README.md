# Tech-Primers
Tech Primers are to jump start delivery with educational step by step resources used to build and have output of associating code and products

## Directory Structure
Each directory contains a Readme with associating images relating to Tech Primer folder.
AKS for example is a Tech Primer on how to build an AKS cluster with necessary Carmax
policies, access and authorization requirements, and Azure resources. Kick Starters are source code which Tech Primers
leverage to structure educational guidance or instructional based implementations for others to expedite understanding.
Outside of screenshots and showing, not telling, the reader of a Tech Primer how to build or code products, Kick
Starter code should be primarily used to build out each goal within a Tech Primer.

**IMPORTANT** - Git Submodules are used to accomplish sourcing Kick Starter code for Tech Primers, and should be
leveraged where possible. This is a great tool to consume source code
from dependencies and security based versioning. With this tool code that's  
referenced/resourced used within a Tech Primer can be leveraged accordingly. This saves a tremendous
amount of resources on your local machine as well as clone/push/pull efficiencies.
For details on how Git Submodules are structured, please refer to 
[Git SubModules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

Each Tech Primer should follow framework:
- Goal or Product Output Name
  - images (for storing rendered ReadMe markdown images)
  - ReadMe.md (screenshot and instructional guided steps on creating app, product, goal, output)
  - Git Submodule for source code or larger code resources
  - Additional References (if not needed, disregard this folder)

For contributing to Tech Primers, creating new Tech Primers, or consuming resources out of connected 
Repos such as Kick Starters, Blueprints, or Reference Architectures, refer to sections below
and depending on which sub-directory (Contribute or Create), you will use "Template Tech Primer" in
this repository. If you have further assistance needed, you can reach out to Cloud Platform Ops team (CPE).

## Tech Primer Contribution Workflows

### Prerequisites
- Purpose of Tech Primers, Kick Starters, Blueprints, and Reference Architectures:
  [Why Tech Primers?](https://carmax.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/HCSCloudTeam/ERhvysvP-AtOhEA2fxAWlF0B3nFtl8rOOH9AerQMXF3tOw?e=if1bYC). This is a Technical Development Framework (TDF) used amongst the general development
  community for collaboration and shared resources.

### Assumptions
- Reader is familiar with the reasoning and purpose of each sub-category of TDF (Tech Primers,
  Kick Starters, Blueprints, Reference Architectures) and why someone would use one category over the other.
- Understanding of [GitHub Topics](https://github.blog/2017-01-31-introducing-topics/)

### Instructions

To contribute Tech Primers, there are guidelines on syntax and styling for the purpose of consistency and
ease of reader's understanding. Basic guiding principle of Tech Primers: "When in doubt, screenshot it out!"

Many guidance documents will tell the reader how to go about executing the process. This is helpful in some
instances, but the goal of a Tech Primer is not only to show the reader how to implement or execute a task, it
is also for their learning purposes. By showing the reader what to press and where to execute a task the
author implicitly demonstrates frame of reference. This exponentially helps the reader to understand and
more appropriately go about instantiation.

#### Contributing to Current Tech Primer

Refer to: [Contribute ReadMe](./Contribute/ReadMe.md)

- ReadMe.md is located under Contribute folder. 

#### Creating New Tech Primer

Refer to: [Create ReadMe](./Create/ReadMe.md)

- ReadMe.md is located under Create folder.

#### Why Tech Primers have advantage

Tech Primers have 3 major addressable items:
- The community has solutions available, so why not use them?
- Frameworks are a great way to commoditize shared resources.
- TDFâ€™s main principle:  keeping scaled solutions simple.

By following these principles, publication of resources for the community only strengthens and supports
it. In addition to these, searching and finding even similar implementations jump start a developers journey
when searching for how-to answers or guidance.

Please add your work and share your thoughts!
